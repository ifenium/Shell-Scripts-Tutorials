## What are Shell Scripts?

A Shell script is a file that contains a series of commands. The shell reads the file like they've been entered directly from the command line then carries out each command sequentially as written in the script. 
Rember that most things that can be done on the command line can be done with scripts and vice versa. 


## Writing Shell Scripts 

You need a text editor to write your scripts, it could be from the terminal (Vim, Emacs, Nano) or a GUI text editor (VS Code, Sublime or Atom) whatever you're comfortable with maybe notepad but remeber that the file must contain ASCII text. 

  The first line of your scripy is important and should begin with `#!/bin/bash`. It is a special construct, called a **shebang**, given to the system indicating what program is to be used to interpret the script. In this case, /bin/bash.
